"""
We can also use LDA itself as a classifier. In this case, scikit-learn will project the data onto a subspace and then find a decision boundary that is perpendicular to that subspace. Put simply, it will do LDA and use the result to find a linear decision boundary.

Since weâ€™ve already fit lda to X and y, we can simply look at the accuracy of the model by using the score() method.
