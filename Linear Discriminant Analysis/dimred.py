"""
The beans data set comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original data set contains data for seven different kinds of beans, but for the sake of simplicity youâ€™ll only look at two classes: barbunya beans and cali beans. The task is to classify beans based on their size and shape. There are 16 independent variables.

Use scikit-learn to create an LDA model called lda. Use the fit_transform() method to fit lda to X and y and create a 1-dimensional subspace called X_new.

Fit the logistic regression model to the new subspace X_new and y. Then create a variable called lr_acc and set it to the accuracy of the logistic regression model. You can use the score() method to find the accuracy. Then print lr_acc.
